# PyCraft

## Overview
**PyCraft** is a basic 3D block-based game built using the [Ursina Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/). The project features a simple first-person perspective, block placement, and destruction mechanics, similar to Minecraft. Players can explore the generated terrain and interact with the world by placing or removing blocks.
